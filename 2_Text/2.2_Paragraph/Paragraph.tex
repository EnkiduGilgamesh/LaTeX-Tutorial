                Donald Knuth’s TEX, a computerized typesetting system, provides nearly
                everything needed for high-quality typesetting of mathematical notations
                as well as of ordinary text. It is particularly notable for its flexibility, its
                superb hyphenation, and its ability to choose aesthetically satisfying line
                breaks. Because of its extraordinary capabilities, TEX has become the
                leading typesetting system for mathematics, science, and engineering and
                has been adopted as a standard by the American Mathematical Society.

            The year 2021 marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). 
            Over the past century, the CPC has invested a huge effort in human rights 
            protection, adding significantly to global human rights progress.

            A hundred years ago, the CPC came into being – its mission to salvage the 
            country and save the Chinese people at a perilous time of domestic upheaval 
            and foreign aggression. This was an epoch-changing moment. Under the leadership 
            of the CPC, the Chinese people embarked on a new journey towards prosperity, 
            national rejuvenation, and wellbeing.
